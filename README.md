# Route Finder with Points of Interest (POI) Filtering

Welcome to the **Route Finder with POI Filtering** project. This tool allows users to find routes between two locations, while also exploring various Points of Interest (POIs) such as restaurants, cafes, hotels, and more. Users can adjust the maximum distance for the route, and dynamically filter POIs based on selected categories. The project leverages Firebase as the backend for storing and retrieving location data and ratings, and it uses Leaflet.js for rendering the map and routes.

## How to Use

1. **Select Start and End Points**:
   - Click on the map to choose a start point and an end point. You can also drag the markers to adjust their positions.
   - The start and end points will be visually highlighted on the map.

2. **Choose Categories of Interest**:
   - Check the boxes for the categories of Points of Interest (POIs) you want to include, such as restaurants, cafes, hotels, and more. 
   - Only POIs that fall under the selected categories and meet your distance criteria will be shown on the map.

3. **Adjust Maximum Route Distance**:
   - Use the slider at the bottom of the form to set the maximum allowed distance for the route in kilometers. 
   - POIs will be dynamically filtered based on this distance.

4. **Generate the Route**:
   - Once you've selected the start and end points, chosen your categories, and set the route distance, click the "Generate Route" button to calculate the route.
   - A route will be generated and displayed on the map. Along with the route, the filtered POIs will appear based on your selections.

5. **POI Information**:
   - For each POI shown on the map, a custom icon will represent its category. Click on the icons to see more details, such as the name, category, and rating.
   - The ratings are shown on a scale of 1-10 and are fetched dynamically from Firebase.

6. **Refreshing the Map**:
   - To start over or choose new points and filters, click the "Refresh" button. This will reset the map and allow you to choose new start and end points, categories, and distances.

7. **Route Distance and Time**:
   - After generating a route, the total distance (in kilometers) and estimated time (in hours and minutes) will be displayed beneath the map.

## Backend Algorithms

The backend of this project is powered by Python, and it handles the core algorithms for route calculation, filtering Points of Interest (POIs), and managing distance constraints. Below is a breakdown of the key backend functionality:

### 1. **Route Calculation**:
   - The backend retrieves the start and end points selected by the user, and using Python's `haversine` formula, it calculates the great-circle distance between two points on the Earth.
   - This distance is used to determine if a POI is within the maximum allowed distance specified by the user.
   - The route generation algorithm ensures that only POIs within the specified distance range are included in the route.

### 2. **POI Filtering**:
   - After the user selects categories of interest (such as restaurants, cafes, etc.), the backend algorithm filters out the POIs that fall under those categories.
   - POIs are further filtered by their proximity to the selected start and end points. Only those that lie within the combined start-to-end distance and fall within the user's maximum distance setting will be displayed.

### 3. **Dynamic Rating System**:
   - For each POI, the backend assigns a random rating between 1 and 10 (floating point), which simulates real-world user ratings. These ratings are generated using Python's `random.uniform()` function.
   - The ratings are updated dynamically in the Firebase database and are displayed to the user as part of the POI's detailed information.

### 4. **Firebase Integration**:
   - The backend is tightly integrated with Firebase, which is used for storing and retrieving POIs, route requests, and responses.
   - Python interacts with Firebase using the `firebase-admin` SDK to retrieve the list of POIs, update their ratings, and store route requests and their corresponding calculated results.
   - The backend efficiently updates the Firebase database in bulk to minimize the number of network requests, ensuring faster performance.

### 5. **Maximum Distance Filtering**:
   - Users can set a maximum allowed distance for the route via the frontend slider. The backend uses this value to filter POIs by their total distance from the start and end points.
   - The backend ensures that only POIs that fall within the specified range are returned, optimizing the displayed results and avoiding unnecessary clutter on the map.

### 6. **Real-time POI and Route Updates**:
   - The backend listens for changes in the Firebase database and triggers real-time updates to the frontend when the POIs or route data is modified. This ensures that users always have the most up-to-date information without needing to refresh the page.

By leveraging Python's powerful libraries for distance calculations and data management, this backend efficiently processes user requests and dynamically generates route and POI information in real-time.

## Firebase Configuration

In this project, Firebase is used to manage real-time data, including storing location-based points of interest (POIs) and route requests/responses. Below are the steps to configure Firebase:

### Steps to Set Up Firebase:
1. **Create a Firebase Project:**
   - Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Create a new Firebase project by following the prompts.

2. **Add a Web App to Firebase:**
   - In the Firebase console, navigate to the "Project Settings" and find the option to add a web app.
   - Once created, Firebase will provide a configuration object. Youâ€™ll use this in your frontend to initialize Firebase.

3. **Set Up Firebase Realtime Database:**
   - In the Firebase console, enable the Realtime Database under the "Build" section.
   - Create a new database and select the appropriate location for your data.

4. **Set Up Firebase Authentication (Optional):**
   - If your project requires authentication, enable Firebase Authentication under the "Authentication" tab.
   - You can configure authentication providers, such as email/password or social logins.

5. **Add Firebase SDK to Your Project:**
   - In your frontend code, initialize Firebase using the configuration details provided when you added the web app. This typically includes the API key, project ID, database URL, and other Firebase credentials.

   ```javascript
   // Initialize Firebase
   const firebaseConfig = {
     apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
     authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
     databaseURL: "YOUR_DATABASE_URL",
     projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
     storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
     messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
     appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
     measurementId: "YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID"
   };
   firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
   const db = firebase.database();

### 6. Structure of Firebase Data

Firebase Realtime Database is central to managing Points of Interest (POIs), route requests, and route responses. Here's how the data is structured:

#### 6.1 **`locations`**:
   - This node stores details of POIs such as restaurants, cafes, hotels, etc.
   - Each POI includes:
     - `name`: Name of the location (e.g., "Restaurant ABC")
     - `category`: Type of location (e.g., "restaurant", "cafe")
     - `x`, `y`: Latitude and longitude
     - `rating`: Randomly generated rating (1-10)
   - Example:
     ```json
     {
       "locations": {
         "poi1": {
           "name": "Restaurant ABC",
           "category": "restaurant",
           "x": 31.771534,
           "y": 35.2223878,
           "rating": 8.7
         }
       }
     }
     ```

#### 6.2 **`routeRequests`**:
   - Stores user-submitted route requests, including:
     - `start`: Coordinates for the start point
     - `end`: Coordinates for the end point
     - `categories`: List of selected POI categories
     - `maxDistanceKm`: Maximum distance for the route
   - Example:
     ```json
     {
       "routeRequests": {
         "request1": {
           "start": { "lat": 31.771534, "lon": 35.2223878 },
           "end": { "lat": 31.7802464, "lon": 35.221699 },
           "categories": ["restaurant", "cafe"],
           "maxDistanceKm": 10
         }
       }
     }
     ```

#### 6.3 **`routeResponses`**:
   - Contains the backend-calculated routes with details of selected POIs:
     - `path`: Array of POIs along the route
     - Each POI includes `name`, `category`, `lat`, `lon`, and `rating`
   - Example:
     ```json
     {
       "routeResponses": {
         "response1": {
           "requestId": "request1",
           "path": [
             { "lat": 31.771534, "lon": 35.2223878, "name": "Restaurant ABC", "category": "restaurant", "rating": 8.7 }
           ]
         }
       }
     }
     ```
